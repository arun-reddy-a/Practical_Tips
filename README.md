# Practical_Tips
This Repository would contain good cood practices and ideas to practice.

You should practice reading code as if they are research papers. Only by doing this you can level up your game.

Wide Resnet (Example code for training in professional settings) [https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks]
Robust Overfitting (Example code for training in professional settings) [https://github.com/locuslab/robust_overfitting]
Low Curvature Activations (Example code for training in professional settings) [https://github.com/vasusingla/low_curvature_activations?tab=readme-ov-file]

After going through these codebases you would understand the fundaments of Professional Neural Network Training. Such as logging, checkpointing, early stopping, lr scheduling etc.
